# feasy-v2

Finite Element Analysis Made Easy - v2. 

This repo is part of an effort to build an efficient, cross-platform FEA solver for 2-D/3-D struct problems. May include some TopOp as well. 

Project started to try and teach myself C++, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Optimization, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
